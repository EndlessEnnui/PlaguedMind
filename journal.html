            <h2>Entry 1: Day I</h2>
            <p>A great deal of misfortune has befell upon the land today. The village that we've traded with over in the East has been succumbed by a great disease. Rumor has it that over half of the population was buried within a fortnight. As far as I know we are still in commerce with that village regardless, hopefully we do not live to regret it.</p>

            <h2>Entry 2: Day VII</h2>
            <p>Two new visitors, a boy named Todd and his older sister Mary, have arrived from the East village. They state that they are the last of their village and seek refuge here before they too become victims of the plague. My village agreed to provide them shelter with the Miller's until they can situate a permanent home to stay in. I can't image how devastated they must be, losing their family and friends just in a matter of days. I wouldn't wish such an event on anyone, even my greatest enemies.</p>

            <p> The house is coming along quite swell. Although it won't be grandeous in any shape imaginable, it was enough for a growing girl to help raise her younger sibling without any worry of being exposed to the elements. I volunteered to look after the two from time to time as I myself have lost my parents to a disease years ago. Poor children, its such an unfortunate fate to their family. If only I could've done something to change their family's fate.</p>

            <h2>Entry 4: Day XVII</h2>
            <p> Cases of the plague have been showing up in my village. The infected were advised to remain in their homes as they await their turn with Doctor Williams. Mary and Todd are petrified, they worry that the village will fall into the same fate as their own. I assured them that it would never come to that and I would do anything to protect them from becoming victim to the plague that consumed their family.

            <h2>Entry 5: Day XXXI</h2>
            <p> The village is in panic. Doctor Williams has fell ill along with the others. The population dwindles as more of our people show signs of fevers and pouring out their innards across the floors. I've instructed the children remain in their home and that everything will be fine, even though they know well enough that the end is drawing near. I know that I'm not the brightest flower in the gallery but I have to try something, ANYTHING. I need to try for their sake.

            <h2>Entry 6: Day XXXIV</h2>
            <p> It's been quite some time since I've updated the journal. To make haste of things, I have taken in the Mary and Todd into my home, the disease has run rapid amongst the people and being alone in their home but I think I've finally found a method that can help my people. A doctor named Charles de L'Orme seems to have crafted a mask and suit that can not only prevent the the wearer from smelling the dreaded decay of man but also make the wearer immune to disease. I've decided to task myself to make such an outfit so that I could help my village recover from these awful times.

            <h2>Entry 7: Day XXXIX</h2>
            <p> I've finalized my plan for my first experiment to curing the plague, word has spread throughout the land that the disease is actually spread through the air and can be identified by the horrid smell of rotting flesh. Although I don't have the resources to make the remaining people of my village masks of their own, I've come to the conclusion that I could kill the plague in the air surrounding and inside my people's lungs through the use of smoke. I will set a fire in town square for the people to breathe in the fumes and cleanse the air and their bodies from disease.

            <h2>Entry 8: Day LXVII</h2>
            <p> Results of the first experiment have been inconclusive. After explaining my theory to the village, villagers began inhaling the smoke near daily for weeks. Women held their children close to the fires, nearly burning the hair on top of their heads to block out the disease as best they can. The men stood where the wind blew to have the smoke blow straight into their faces. Some even set their bodies on fire as they believed the fire would burn away the plague from their bodies. Although the stench of rotting flesh has prominently decreased, the symptoms remained the same. I've since buried several of my once close friends now and burned their corpses to ash to prevent their decaying bodies from spreading the plague more than it already has.

            <h2>Entry 9: Day LXXXV</h2>
            <p> A few weeks have gone by and Todd has now been cursed with the plague. Mary hasn't taken the news well whatsoever. Her days consist of gazing out of the window of her room in complete silence, thinking of the inevitable faith her brother will reach in the near future. Todd is by far way too sick to feel anything but pain in his body. He currently resides in the new hospital where priests and nuns care fo the infected, only God can save him now the people say. I believe there has to be another way. Records documenting medicine from lands afar state that consuming pure mercury will allow the body to sweat bad humours away from the body. I have arranged a deal with a merchant over on the mainland in order to give to Todd, in the mean time I must try other means to keep him alive unil then.

            <h2>Entry 10: Day XCII</h2>
            <p> Mary is no longer in a responsive state at the moment as Todd's life has succumbed to the plague a few days ago. It has been a difficult time for the both of us. The priests say that it was a miracle he even lasted more than a week. Todd was such a strong and resilient one. The village population is at an all time low and I barely have the time to keep Mary company during her grief. The mercury I ordered from the merchant has arrived during today's shipment. I plan to give it to Mary in hopes that she will be protected from the same fate as her brother. May God save her soul. Most days I have been cleaning the streets of organs and corpse from those who met their swift end. But on that day I couldn't hand looking upon the child I took in as my own.
